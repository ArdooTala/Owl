# Owl
The libraries of the Owl framework.

## Intro
These libraries are a basic interface for machine-learning-oriented data pre- and post-processing.
Including normalization, processing and serialization methods, some visualizations, expression evaluation functions etc.
Created as an open-source basis for other developers and myself.

## Solutions
There are 8 solutions in this repository:
1. Owl.Core (the core Owl library declaring all the data types)
2. Owl.Learning (machine learning methods)
3. Owl.GH.Common (the library to use when developing GH plugins which use the GH_OwlTensor etc.)
4. Owl.GH (grasshopper plugin with basic Owl components + Owl.Learning components)
5. Owl.Accord.Extensions (methods extending Accord library to handle Owl types)
6. Owl.Accord.GH.Common (the library to use when developing GH plugins which use the Accord-related Owl types)
7. Owl.Accord.GH (grasshopper plugin with Accord-based components) 
8. Owl.ParamSetup (project showing how to setup your GH plugin to use the Owl.Core and Owl.GH.Common)
