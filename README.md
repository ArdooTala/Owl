# Owl.Core
Core library of the Owl framework

## Intro
This library is a basic interface for machine-learning-oriented data pre- and post-processing.
Includes normalization, processing and serialization methods, some visualizations, expression evaluation functions etc.
Created as an open-source basis for other developers and myself.

## How do I use that ? 
Take a look at the Snippets folder. 
While it's all VB, once compiled you can use it in any .NET language (IronPython, C#, F# etc.) 
For C#-minded people who want to read the code better, there are free online VB<>C# converters.

## Usage
Clone and build. No dependencies other than the native .NET
